# Overview

Nodiak is a node.js client to [the Riak distributed database](http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/).  The focus of Nodiak is to provide a client that mimics some of the patterns and functionality of Basho's official clients for other languages while still taking advantage of the benefits of asynchronous patterns that can be easily implemented in node.js.


# Installation

    $ npm install nodiak

# Tests

The test suite can be run by simply:

    $ cd /path/to/nodiak
    $ npm test

The suite expects to find Riak on an HTTP interface on port 8091 and an HTTPS interface on port 8071.  You can edit these values at the top of the `test/test.js` file to suit your environment.
